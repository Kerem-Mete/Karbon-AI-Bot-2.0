🌍✨ Welcome to the Carbon Footprint Universe! ✨🌍

Hey there, fellow Earth protector! 🌱💚

You've just entered a world where your daily habits matter — not just to you, but to the entire planet! 🌎⚡ This project is not just about numbers and charts — it’s a journey, a movement, a 🌪️ revolution toward a greener and cleaner future! 🌿🌤️

Let’s talk Carbon Footprint — a fancy name for the total amount of greenhouse gases 🚗💨 you produce through everyday actions like driving, eating, using electricity, and even taking a shower! 🚿🔌🍔

🔍 What Do We Track?

🚗 Car Usage – Are you driving a lot or going green with biking? 🚴‍♀️

💡 Electricity Consumption – How much energy are those gadgets using? 📱💻

🚿 Water Usage – Every drop counts! 💧

🥩 Meat Intake – Burgers or beans? 🌱🍔

Every small habit adds up to something big — really big. 🌋 And guess what? You have the power to change it. 💪♻️

📊 Why It Matters

The Earth is heating up 🔥 — glaciers are melting 🧊, forests are shrinking 🌲, and weather is getting weirder 🌪️. But together, we can slow it down, heal the planet, and build a future that's cooler (literally). 😎🌧️

This bot helps you understand your carbon impact in a fun, easy, and powerful way. 🚀 Each time you use it, you’re learning more about how you affect the Earth — and how to do better. 🌻🌈
